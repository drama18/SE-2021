# Project Description

The "Mentorship Program" of Epoka University is a great initiative designed for students offering support and help to other students that want to discover their interests and become high performing individuals. However, the program has continuously encountered difficulties through the years for various reasons. So, we aim to build a software product that will come in hand to the school.

## Why is the Mentorship Program in need of our service?

The program has not functioned properly for the students that seek help, mostly because: 
- Many students feel sceptic towards getting a traditional one-to-one tutoring from seniors they don't know
- They can't manage to always find the time for physical meetings since the workload is already too much
- They can't find mentors for the subjects they're applying for

On the other hand, the students that want to offer help are faced with problems like:
- Not having clear instructions of how the tasks and the responsibilites are divided
- Not finding the time to make one-to-one meetings with each one of the students
- Keeping track of the progress and the assignments they appoint

## What are we offering?

A web & mobile application that solely serves the purpose of the Mentorship program, to facilitate the tasks management of both the mentors & students, and ease their communication.

The regular users (users that seek help) can:
1. See the available courses offered in their department & request to enroll in the ones they need help with
2. Follow the instructions of the mentor based on what they're assigned to study and complete
3. Elaborate on any questions or uncertainties to the private/group chat with the mentor
4. See the mentor's timetable for their free hours during the week
5. Request a one-to-one appointment, etc
6. Rate the mentor at the end of the course & see the Honors Dashboard for best-performance students during the semester

The admins (mentors) can:
1. Create courses based on the subjects they feel confident to teach
2. Accept enrollment invitations on their classes - either one student or a group of students, up to them to decide
3. Assign reading lists, watching lists, quizzes to the students
4. Create a chat to communicate 
5. Weekly update their free hours on their timetable
6. Keep a private to-do list on what things have been achieved until now, what tasks are being done and what are the future goals for the course
7. Retrieve the Certificate of Completion based on the ratings of the students & the course given

Other features: to be updated
